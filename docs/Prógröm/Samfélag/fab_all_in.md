Designed to increase belonging, expand (inclusive, urgent, enivro-social-econ-cultural-etc) impact, and create community
___

Does your fab community match the make-up of your whole community, with all neighbors feeling welcome, showing up, leading, financially supported, visible, and …?

* If yes, please join us and come share your work and methods along with others!
* If not, come join us – and hear different ways others have been solving for inclusive Fab communities! You can do this!
* Either way, or not exactly applicable? [Come join us](https://form.jotform.com/233204082631647){:rel="nofollow"}

This interactive set of eight sessions builds skills, knowledge, and capability around the social systems needed to co-evolve with digital fabrication technologies.

**We call it “Fab All-In” to signal that both “all topics” and “all people”** could experience welcome in the journey to positive social, economic, environmental creative impact, personal self-expression, leadership/leader-shop, and community self-sufficiency.”


### Course Structure:

* We begin by hearing innovators from the FabLab network sharing some innovations already happening in this way. 
    *Themed sessions with a series of short presentations from regional leaders elevate stories of existing exceptional work from teams around the world – especially hearing from labs and initiatives that have scaled inclusive to those people and topics that have been under-represented in the Fab network.
    *Each session will also feature application opportunities and interaction— including a curriculum for exploring and developing plans, dialog with colleagues, sharing more details about challenges with solutions people developed iteratively, and conducting collaborative project development input sessions.
* Two skills deep-dive sessions later in the semester will workshop several skills areas, plus an optional open-office hours session for co-working time.
* The final session will be a Solutionspalooza to share early solutions-in-progress and hear more details about emerging initiatives we discover along the way.
